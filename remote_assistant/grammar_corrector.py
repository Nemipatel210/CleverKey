# 1. Direct Correction
# template = """Text: {text}
#     Instructions: 
#     1. Proofread the text for grammatical errors, including spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.
#     2. Correct any identified errors.
#     3. Rewrite the corrected text below, maintaining the original meaning and intent as closely as possible.
#     4. In Response you need to provide JUST corrected paragraph so that I can replace it directly.
